1.Pig script find the average age of male and female persons died in the titanic tragedy

titanic = load '/user/acadgild/titanicdata.txt' using PigStorage(',') as 
(Passengerid:int, Survived:int, Pclass:int, Name, Sex:chararray, Age:int, Sibsp:int, Parch:int, Ticket:chararray, Fare:float, Cabin:chararray, Embarked:chararray);

ftitanic = filter titanic by Survived == 1;

male = filter ftitanic by Sex == 'male';

female = filter ftitanic by Sex == 'female';

gm = group male all;

gf = group female all;

om = foreach gm generate AVG(male.age);

of = foreach gf generate AVG(female.age);

dump om;  

dump of;


2. Pig script to find the number of people died and survived in each class.


titanic = load '/user/acadgild/titanicdata.txt' using PigStorage(',') as 
(Passengerid:int,Survived:int, Pclass:int, Name, Sex:chararray, Age:int, Sibsp:int, Parch:int, Ticket:chararray, Fare:float, Cabin:chararray, Embarked:chararray);


dead = filter titanic by Survived == 0;
surv = filter titanic by Survived == 1;

gd = group dead by Pclass;

gs = group survived by Pclass;

od = foreach gd generate COUNT(dead);

os = foreach gs generate COUNT(surv);

dump od;  

dump os;
